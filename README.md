# Fruit Image Classification Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on classifying fresh and rotten fruits using image data. The project was conducted as part of the MSc Business Administration and Data Science program at Copenhagen Business School by the 3M group. The primary objective is to address inefficiencies and waste associated with manual quality inspections in the fruit production industry.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of approximately 12,000 augmented images of fresh and rotten fruit varieties. The images were sourced from [this website](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bdd69gyhv8/1). Proper attribution and acknowledgment to the data source are essential.

## Project Structure

- **code**: Contains Jupyter Notebook files with Python scripts used for implementing the models.
- **data**: Dataset sourced from [this source](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bdd69gyhv8/1).
- **report**: Contains the formal report with in-depth details about the project.

## Report

The detailed report, titled "Promoting Sustainable Food Systems: A Comparative Study of Random Forest, SVM, and CNN for Fresh and Rotten Fruit Classification," is included in the repository. The report discusses the motivation, methodology, and findings of the study. The key conclusion is that the choice of model for practical implementation depends on industry-specific goals and circumstances.

## Conceptual Framework and Methodology

To answer the core research question, "How does the choice of supervised machine learning approach impact the performance of classifying fresh and rotten fruit?" we developed and adhered to the conceptual framework depicted in Figure 1.

## How to Use

To reproduce the results or extend the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MachineLearning-ImageClassification-Fruit.git
   ```

2. Set up your Python environment with the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Explore the code in the `code` directory to understand the implementation of Random Forest, SVM, and CNN models.

4. Use the provided dataset or replace it with your own dataset, ensuring it follows the same structure.

5. Run the Python scripts to train and evaluate the models.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in addressing inefficiencies and waste in the fruit production industry. By comparing Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Convolutional Neural Network models, the study provides valuable insights into the choice of supervised machine learning approaches for fruit classification.
